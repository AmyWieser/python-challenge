Python-Challenge

This assignment was two-fold, analyzing csv datasets through the use of Python code.  These are summarized below.

Pybank exercise

I was given a csv file containing data for profits/losses by month for a company.  With this file, I wrote python code to create an output containing the summary information in my terminal (Gitbash).  The output is shown below.



I also wrote code to print this information into a text file as well.


Pypoll exercise

I was given a csv file containing data for votes by voter ID for particular candidates in an election.  With this file, I wrote python code to create an output containing the summary information in my terminal (Gitbash).  The output is shown below.
